# Tensegrity-Dynamics-and-Optimal-Control
Tensegrity Robots are a biologically-inspired approach to building robots based on the tension networks of tensegrity structures, which have no rigid connections between elements. This repository contains some of my research and relevant software tools related to optimal control of tensegrity robots!
